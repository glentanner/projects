# Automate with Python – Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of small Python scripts written as part of my journey to automate everyday tasks and data processing. Each script is standalone and focused on solving a specific problem, usually something practical or personally useful.

## Getting Started

The first script is a basic file reader that:
- Prompts the user to select a file
- Reads the file
- Prints the contents to the screen

This script is a starting point for building more complex tools to handle structured data, automate manual tasks, and explore small-scale data engineering workflows.

## Running the Script

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. To run the starter script:

```bash
python3 file_reader.py
```

(Replace `file_reader.py` with the actual name of your script.)

## Folder Structure

```
projects/
├── file_reader.py          # Prompts user to choose a file and prints it
├── another_script.py       # Future script placeholder
├── yet_another_tool.py     # More automation to come
└── ...
```

## Goals

- Build practical automation tools
- Learn and apply Python file handling, parsing, and error checking
- Improve personal productivity and reduce repetitive work
